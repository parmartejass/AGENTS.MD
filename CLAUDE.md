# CLAUDE.md (Loader Stub)

Hard gate:
- Before doing any work, open and follow `AGENTS.md`.
- If you cannot access repository files, request that the user paste `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not implement changes unless `AGENTS.md` is in-context.

Context injection (REQUIRED):
- After reading `AGENTS.md`, follow its "Context Injection Procedure (Hard Gate)" section (consult `agents-manifest.yaml`, load injected docs/playbooks, and use `fallback_inject` if no profile matches).

If any conflict exists, `AGENTS.md` is authoritative.
