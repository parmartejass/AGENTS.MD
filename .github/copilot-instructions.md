Hard gate:
- Read and follow `/AGENTS.md` before generating or reviewing code.
- If `/AGENTS.md` is not accessible, request it from the user.
- If any conflict exists, `/AGENTS.md` is authoritative.
- Use `agents-manifest.yaml` to determine which supporting docs/playbooks to load for this task.

Do not proceed without `/AGENTS.md` in-context.
