title: "Example: Git-native memory storage format"

content: |
  This is an example learning entry demonstrating the git-native memory format.

  The git-native provider stores each learning as a YAML file that is:
  - Version-controlled (full audit trail)
  - Human-readable and editable
  - Works offline without dependencies
  - Searchable via grep/ripgrep

  Trade-off: No semantic search (keyword matching only).
  For semantic search, use ChromaDB or Supermemory providers.
