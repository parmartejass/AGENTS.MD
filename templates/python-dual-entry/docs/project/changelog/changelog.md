update_trigger: non-trivial work closes OR closure-record field contract changes

# Changelog

## Boundary
- This branch owns tracked closure-record facts for completed non-trivial work.
- It does not own behavior, invariants, project goals, rules, data truth, architecture, implementation rationale, active work, raw prompts, transcripts, or unpromoted working evidence.

## Invariant
- Each closure record references the owning docs/code/config/data/workflow authority for durable facts, or records `N/A + reason`.
- A closure record must not substitute for owner-doc promotion.
- Raw secrets, credentials, PII, customer data, and oversized pasted artifacts must not be stored here.

## Field Contract
- Closure-record field template/order is owned by `docs/agents/90-release-checklist/release-checklist.md`.
- Entries must follow that owner instead of redefining the field template here.

## Entries
- None currently declared.
