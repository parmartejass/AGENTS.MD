# Learning Notes (Project-Specific)

Purpose: capture practical learnings that help future changes, without turning docs into a second SSOT.

Keep this focused on:
- pitfalls and failure modes discovered in real runs
- operational gotchas (paths, permissions, environment differences)
- verification tips (how to reproduce/confirm outcomes)

Avoid:
- duplicating constants/defaults (reference the SSOT owner instead)
- re-implementing business rules in prose (reference the named rule functions/workflows)
