Hard gates:
- Read and follow `AGENTS.md` (SSOT). If you cannot access it, ask before doing any work.
- Follow the Context Injection Procedure from `AGENTS.md`.
- Do NOT edit `.governance/` from a parent repo. Propose governance changes only.

Task type: governance_improvement (proposal-only)

Goal:
- Review the last 24 hours of work (threads, logs, notes). If you cannot access them, ask for a session recap.
- Update the project learning doc at `{{LEARNING_DOC}}` with concise, repo-specific learnings.
- Write governance proposals (if any) to `{{GOVERNANCE_PROPOSALS}}`.
- Write a short review report to `{{REVIEW_REPORT}}` summarizing what you captured.

Constraints:
- Keep changes minimal and deterministic.
- Do not add dependencies.
- No silent skips; record SKIPPED + reason if something cannot be done.

Verification:
- If you modify docs under `docs/`, ensure required headers are present.
- Provide exact verification commands or deterministic manual checks.

Output:
- List files changed and why.
- Call out any open questions or unknowns.
